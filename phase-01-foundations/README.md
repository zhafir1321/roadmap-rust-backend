## üíª Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Syntax (Day 1-4)
Create small programs to practice:
1. Variable declarations and modifications
2. Function definitions with parameters and return values
3. Control flow with different conditions
4. Basic calculations and string manipulation

### Exercise 2: Ownership Practice (Day 5-7)
Write programs that demonstrate:
1. Moving ownership between variables
2. Borrowing with references
3. Mutable vs immutable references
4. String slices and array slices

### Exercise 3: Git Workflow (Day 8-10)
Practice Git commands:
1. Initialize a repository
2. Make commits with meaningful messages
3. Create and merge branches
4. Handle merge conflicts

## üöÄ Phase 1 Project: Personal Task Manager CLI

### Project Requirements

Build a command-line task management application with the following features:

#### Core Features:
1. **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks with a description
2. **List Tasks**: Display all tasks with their status (pending/completed)
3. **Complete Task**: Mark a task as completed
4. **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the list
5. **Save/Load**: Persist tasks to a file between program runs

#### Technical Requirements:
- Use Rust structs to represent tasks
- Implement proper error handling
- Use collections (Vec, HashMap) appropriately
- Save data to a JSON or simple text file
- Use command-line arguments for different operations

#### Example Usage:
```bash
# Add a new task
./task_manager add "Learn Rust ownership"

# List all tasks
./task_manager list

# Complete a task
./task_manager complete 1

# Delete a task
./task_manager delete 2
```

#### Git Requirements:
- Initialize a Git repository for your project
- Make frequent commits with descriptive messages
- Create a README.md explaining how to use your application
- Use branches for different features
- Tag your final version as "v1.0"

### Project Structure:
```
phase-01-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task.rs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ storage.rs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
```

### Assessment Criteria:
- [ ] All core features work correctly
- [ ] Proper error handling (no panics on user input)
- [ ] Code is well-organized and readable
- [ ] Git history shows good practices
- [ ] README explains the project clearly

### Bonus Challenges:
- Add task priorities (high, medium, low)
- Implement task due dates
- Add task categories/tags
- Create a search functionality
- Add colored output for better UX

## üìù Study Tips
1. **Practice daily**: Even 30 minutes a day is better than cramming
2. **Read the compiler**: Rust's compiler messages are very helpful
3. **Experiment**: Try breaking things to understand how they work
4. **Ask questions**: Use the Rust community forums when stuck
5. **Code review**: Share your code and get feedback
